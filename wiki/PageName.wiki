#summary Manual for setting up the project (in eclipse)

= Introduction =
On this page I will try to give some advice about how to initially set up the project in eclipse.

= Setting up in eclipse =
* First checkout trunk using ´svn checkout https://bolscript.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ bolscript --username your.name´ . Move the trunk folder into your eclipse workspace and rename it to bolscript or whatever.
In eclipse create a new Java Project, select _create from existing source_ and select the folder.
* In Eclipse go to preferences->team->ignored resources and add .project, .classpath, settings.xml, or deselect them at each commit.
* In project preferences make sure the source folders are bolscript_src, bolscript_tests, gat_src, gat_tests, and set the Java Compiler to 1.6 or greater.
