#summary a quick overview over the syntax

= Introduction =
Bolscript features a fairly simple syntax. This page provides an overview. However it might be simpler to look at some examples.

== Example 1 - a complete bolscript file ==

= General structure =
Each composition is kept in one bolscript file with the file ending `.comp.txt`, with the only exception being tals, which need to have the ending `.tal.txt`.

Each bolscript file is made up of key/value packets of the form
`Key: Value`
The program knows certain keys:
 * Editor - the name of the editor of this file
 * Editors - the names, if there is more than one editor
 * Gharana - the name of the gharana of 
 * Gharanas 
 * Name 
 * Tal 
 * Type
 * Types
 * Comment
 * Speed - this is the general speed in number of bols per beat (matra)
Some special keys are reserved for defining tals: 
 * Layout
 * Length
 * Vibhags
You can use any other key, such as `Theme`, `Variation 1` or `A` or `Tihai` to begin a bol sequence.
