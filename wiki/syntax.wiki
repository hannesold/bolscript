== General structure ==
Each composition is kept in one bolscript file with the file ending `.comp.txt`, with the only exception being tals, which need to have the ending `.tal.txt`.

== Key / Value pairs ==
Each bolscript file is made up of key/value packets of the form
`Key: Value`
The program knows certain keys:
 * Editor - the name of the editor of this file
 * Editors - the names, if there is more than one editor
 * Gharana - the name of the gharana of 
 * Gharanas - a comma seperated list of gharanas 
 * Name - a name for the composition, if no name is entered, bolscript attempts to generate one
 * Tal - Set a tal for the upcoming parts of the composition (Example Tal: Teental). Note that only Tals found amoung your tabla folder will be correctly interpretable by bolscript.
 * Type - the composition type, for example Kaida, Tukra, Rela, ...
 * Types - a list of one or more comma seperated types
 * Comment - A Comment which will be displayed in the composition viewer
 * $Comment - A hidden comment.
 * Speed - this is the general speed in number of bols per beat (matra)
Some special keys are reserved for defining tals: 
 * Layout
 * Length
 * Vibhags
You can use _any other key_, such as `Theme`, `Variation 1` or `A` or `Tihai` to begin a bol sequence.

A: dha ge ti te

Note that, because of the leading $, B is not displayed in composition viewer as a sequence of its own.
