#summary Manual for setting up the project (in eclipse) as a developer.
#labels Phase-Requirements,Phase-Implementation

= Developer setup =
== Requirements ==
 * Make sure you have the Java 1.6 JDK or higher.
 * As an IDE I use eclipse with subclipse plugin for svn support. 
== Svn checkout and eclipse project ==
 # Checkout trunk using `svn checkout https://bolscript.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ bolscript --username your.name` . Move the trunk folder into your eclipse workspace and rename it to bolscript or whatever.
 # In eclipse create a new Java Project, select _create from existing source_ and select the  folder.
 # Go to preferences->team->ignored resources and add .project, .classpath, settings.xml, or deselect them at each commit.
 # In project preferences make sure the source folders are bolscript_src, bolscript_tests, gat_src, gat_tests, and set the Java Compiler to 1.6 or greater.
== Required libraries ==
In the project preferences add links to the following libraries:
 * junit 4 - this is part of the jdk
 * itext - this is used for pdf export. Download the itext core jar from http://www.lowagie.com/iText/ 
 * swixml - this is not used in bolscript, but in gat. Get a jar at http://www.swixml.org/.
I have an additional folder 3dparty, where I save this kind of stuff.


= Overview =

Note that two projects are included.
==Bolscript - tabla notation and composition management ==
This is the program, for which I installed this google code site, it should be the focus of your attention. The bolscript source folders are bolscript_src and bolscript_tests and they are independent of the other group called gat
Main class is `bolscript/Master` or `bolscript/MasterMac` for OS X
==Gat - genetic algorithm tabla composition program for kaidas ==
A project I started 2006 in my bachelor report and haven't updated much since then. Gat uses a lot of bolscripts classes. I want to have it in here so it keeps working when refactorings in bolscript are done. Main class is `managing/Manager`.
For details see [gat].

= Running bolscript =
 # Run `bolscript/Master` or `bolscript/MasterMac` (OS X) as a Java Program.
 # Copy the `resources/tablafolder_default` somewhere on your system, and choose it as tabla folder when first running bolscript. 
 # Running bolscript generates a `settings.xml`. Do not add it to svn please.
